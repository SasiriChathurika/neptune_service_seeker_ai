<summary><strong> Dive Deeper: Core Component Logic </strong></summary>

*   📄 **`src/app/page.tsx`**: As the primary entry point for the user interface, this file manages the overall page structure, state for search queries and their corresponding results, and integrates essential child components like the `QueryForm` and `ResultsDisplay`.
*   📄 **`src/components/QueryForm.tsx`**: This dedicated component encapsulates the search input field and the logic for capturing user input and initiating the search request to the backend.
*   📄 **`src/components/ResultsDisplay.tsx`**: Responsible for rendering the processed search results returned from the API. It dynamically displays the synthesized information, including any special formatting or the unique Neptune Scores.
*   📄 **`src/pages/api/query.ts`**: This is the crucial server-side API endpoint. It handles incoming search requests, orchestrates data fetching (potentially using tools like Cheerio for web scraping), communicates with the OpenAI API for result synthesis, and sends the processed data back to the client.
